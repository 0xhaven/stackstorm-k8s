# `stackstorm-enterprise-ha` Helm Chart
StackStorm Enterprise K8s Helm Chart, optimized for running StackStorm in HA environment.

It will install 2 replicas for each component of StackStorm microservices for redundancy, as well as backends like
RabbitMQ HA, MongoDB replicaset and etcd cluster that st2 replies on for MQ, DB and distributed coordination respectively.

It's more than welcome to configure each component in-depth to fit specific availability/scalability demands.

## Requirements
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/) cluster
* [Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#install-helm) and [Tiller](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#initialize-helm-and-install-tiller)

## Usage
1) Edit `values.yaml` with configuration for the StackStorm Enterprise HA K8s cluster.
> NB! It's highly recommended to set your own secrets as file contains unsafe defaults like self-signed SSL certificates, SSH keys,
> StackStorm access and DB/MQ passwords!

2) Pull 3rd party Helm dependencies:
```
helm dependency update
```

3) Install the chart:
```
helm install --set secrets.st2.license=<ST2_LICENSE_KEY> .
```

4) Upgrade.
Once you make any changes to values, upgrade the cluster:
```
helm upgrade --set secrets.st2.license=<ST2_LICENSE_KEY> <release-name> .
```

## Components
### st2web
st2web is a StackStorm Web UI admin dashboard. By default, st2web K8s config includes a Pod Deployment and a Service.
`2` replicas (configurable) of st2web serve the st2 web app and proxify requests to st2auth, st2api, st2stream.
Service uses NodePort, so installing this chart will not provision a K8s resource of type LoadBalancer or Ingress (TODO!).
Depending on your Kubernetes cluster setup you may need to add additional configuration to access the Web UI service or expose it to public net.

### [st2auth](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#st2auth) 
All authentication is managed by `st2auth` service.
K8s configuration includes a Pod Deployment backed by `2` replicas by default and Service of type ClusterIP listening on port `9100`.
Multiple st2auth processes can be behind a load balancer in an active-active configuration and you can increase number of replicas per your discretion.

### [st2api](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#st2api)
Service hosts the REST API endpoints that serve requests from WebUI, CLI, ChatOps and other st2 components.
K8s configuration consists of Pod Deployment with `2` default replicas for HA and ClusterIP Service accepting HTTP requests on port `9101`.
Being one of the most important of StackStorm services with a lot of logic involved,
it's recommended to increase number of replicas to distribute the load if you'd plan increased load demands.

### [st2stream](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#st2stream)
StackStorm st2stream - exposes a server-sent event stream, used by the clients like WebUI and ChatOps to receive update from the st2stream server.
Similar to st2auth and st2api, st2stream K8s configuration includes Pod Deployment with `2` replicas for HA (can be increased in `values.yaml`)
and ClusterIP Service listening on port `9102`.

### [st2rulesengine](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#st2rulesengine)
st2rulesengine evaluates rules when it sees new triggers and decides if new action execution should be requested.
K8s config includes Pod Deployment with `2` (configurable) replicas by default for HA.

### [st2notifier](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#st2notifier)
Multiple st2notifier processes can run in active-active mode, using connections to RabbitMQ and MongoDB and generating triggers based on
action execution completion as well as doing action rescheduling.
In an HA deployment minimum 2 replicas of st2notifier is running, requiring co-ordination backend, which is `etcd` in this case.

### [st2sensorcontainer](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#st2sensorcontainer)
st2sensorcontainer manages StackStorm sensors: starts, stops and restarts them as a subprocesses.
At the moment K8s configuration consists of Deployment with hardcoded `1` replica.
Future plans (#12) to re-work this setup and benefit from Docker-friendly [single-sensor-per-container mode](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/pull/4179)
(since st2 `v2.9`) as a way of [Sensor Partitioning](https://docs.stackstorm.com/latest/reference/sensor_partitioning.html), distributing the computing load
between many pods and relying on K8s failover/reschedule mechanisms, instead of running everything on 1 single instance of st2sensorcontainer.

### [st2actionrunner](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/ha.html#st2actionrunner)
Stackstorm workers that actually execute actions.
`5` replicas for K8s Deployment are configured by default to increase the ability of StackStorm to execute actions.
This is the first thing to lift if you have a lot of actions to execute in your StackStorm cluster.

## Tips & Tricks
Grab all logs for entire StackStorm cluster with dependent services in Helm release:
```
kubectl logs -l release=<release-name>
```

Grab all logs only for stackstorm backend services, excluding st2web and DB/MQ/etcd:
```
kubectl logs -l release=<release-name>,tier=backend
```
